### Overview

pyREX(Python Reaction Energy eXtension), is a free open-source implementation of reaction coordinate analysis techniques that interfaces with PSI4 ab-initio quantum chemistry software in order to streamline the process of investigating energetic/electronic properties along an intrinsic reaction coordinate. This code is currently under development within the Derricotte Research Group at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. Current Key features include:
* Calculating SCF energies along the reaction coordinate
* Reaction Force Analysis
* Reaction Electronic Flux (REF) Analysis
* Decomposition of REF into Polarization and Transfer Components
Much more COMING SOON!

### Getting Started
1. Obtain required software
    1. [pyREX](https://github.com/WDerricotte/pyrex) (must clone this repository; no binary install currently available)
    2. [Psi4](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1/build_obtaining.html) pyREX depends intrinsically on Psi4, currently the easiest way to obtain the code is to download the available binaries available at http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/psicode-download/1.1.html
