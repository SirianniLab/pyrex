pyREX(Python Reaction Energy eXtension), is a free open-source implementation of reaction coordinate analysis techniques that interfaces with PSI4 ab-initio quantum chemistry software in order to streamline the process of investigating energetic/electronic properties along an intrinsic reaction coordinate. This code is currently under development within the Derricotte Research Group at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. Current Key features include:
* Calculating SCF energies along the reaction coordinate
* Reaction Force Analysis
* Reaction Electronic Flux (REF) Analysis
* Decomposition of REF into Polarization and Transfer Components
Much more COMING SOON!
