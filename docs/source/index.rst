Overview
========

pyREX(Python Reaction Energy eXtension), is a free open-source implementation of reaction coordinate analysis techniques that interfaces with popular quantum chemistry software in order to streamline the process of investigating energetic/electronic properties along an intrinsic reaction coordinate. This code is currently under development within the Derricotte Research Group at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA.
